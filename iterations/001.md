# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the `Cost` function for the book-store exercise in a single iteration cycle.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal Phase**: Defined GOAL.md and SCOPE.md with clear acceptance criteria
2. **Design Phase**: Wrote implementation plan using recursive frequency-vector approach; reviewed and approved
3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Implementer wrote the `Cost` function in `book_store.go`
   - Challenger reviewed and approved the implementation
   - Executor ran all 18 tests - all pass, no vet warnings
   - Verifier confirmed all acceptance criteria met - **PASS**

## Algorithm

The solution uses a recursive brute-force approach:
- Count frequency of each book title
- Sort frequencies descending
- At each step, try all possible group sizes (1 to k)
- Deduct one from each of the top k frequencies
- Return the minimum cost across all choices

This correctly handles the key insight that two groups of 4 (5120 cents) is cheaper than a group of 5 + group of 3 (5160 cents).

## Key Files Modified

- `go/exercises/practice/book-store/book_store.go` - Full implementation of `Cost` function

## Test Results

- 18/18 tests pass
- `go vet` clean
- Total test time: 0.63s

## Issues Encountered

None. Single iteration was sufficient.

## Commit
