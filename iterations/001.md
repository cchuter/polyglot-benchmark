# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Summary

Implemented the alphametics puzzle solver for issue #317 in a single iteration. All 10 test cases pass, `go vet` is clean, and the solution completes in under 1 second.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal phase**: Defined clear acceptance criteria and scope boundaries
2. **Design phase**: Evaluated two approaches (column-based backtracking vs algebraic permutation), selected the simpler algebraic approach through structured debate
3. **Implementation**: Wrote `Solve()` function with algebraic coefficient computation and recursive backtracking search
4. **Testing**: All 10 test cases pass including the challenging 199-addend, 10-letter puzzle (0.19s)
5. **Committed and pushed** to `issue-317` branch

## Approach

- Parse puzzle into addend words and result word
- Compute positional coefficients for each unique letter (addends +, result -)
- Recursive backtracking: try digit assignments with uniqueness and leading-zero constraints
- Check if weighted sum equals zero at each complete assignment

## Issues Encountered

None. The algebraic approach worked correctly on the first attempt.

## Performance

| Test Case | Time |
|---|---|
| 3 letters | <1ms |
| 4 letters | <1ms |
| 6 letters | 30ms |
| 7 letters | 50ms |
| 8 letters (SEND+MORE=MONEY) | 340ms |
| 10 letters (199 addends) | 190ms |
| **Total** | **0.91s** |
