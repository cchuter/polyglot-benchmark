# Iteration 001 — Dominoes Chain Solver

## Date: 2026-02-16

## Summary

Successfully implemented the dominoes chain solver in a single iteration. All 12 test cases pass.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope Definition**: Defined clear acceptance criteria (13 items) and scope boundaries
2. **Design**: Planned a two-phase algorithm — Eulerian feasibility check + backtracking DFS
3. **Implementation**: Wrote `MakeChain`, `feasible`, and `backtrack` functions in `dominoes.go`
4. **Review**: Challenger verified correctness of degree counting, connectivity check, and backtracking
5. **Testing**: All 12 tests pass, benchmark runs at ~22,124 ns/op
6. **Verification**: Independent verifier confirmed all acceptance criteria met — **PASS**

## Algorithm

- **Feasibility**: Check all vertex degrees are even (Eulerian condition) and graph is connected (BFS)
- **Construction**: Backtracking DFS trying each unused domino in both orientations, starting from `input[0][0]`
- **Edge cases**: Empty input → `([], true)`, single self-loop → valid, single non-loop → invalid, disconnected → invalid

## Files Modified

- `go/exercises/practice/dominoes/dominoes.go` — Complete implementation (105 lines)

## Issues Encountered

None. Single iteration, clean pass.

## Team

- Implementer: Wrote the solution, committed
- Challenger: Thorough code review, no issues found
- Executor: Build + tests + benchmarks all pass
- Verifier: All 13 acceptance criteria confirmed — PASS
