# Iteration 001 - Final

## Summary
Single-iteration implementation of the alphametics solver. All acceptance criteria met on first pass.

## What Was Accomplished
- Implemented `Solve` function in `go/exercises/practice/alphametics/alphametics.go`
- Used a weight/coefficient-based backtracking algorithm
- All 10 test cases pass in 0.003s
- Code reviewed, tested, and verified

## Algorithm
The solver converts each letter into a weight (sum of place-value contributions across addend words minus result word). A valid solution makes the weighted sum of digits equal zero. Letters are sorted by |weight| descending for optimal pruning during backtracking.

## Issues Encountered
- Initial column-based approach had a carry propagation bug (columns completing out of order couldn't be verified)
- Switched to coefficient-based approach which avoids carry tracking entirely

## Key Decisions
1. Coefficient-based approach over column-based: simpler, no carry bugs, equally fast
2. Sort by |weight| descending: assigns most impactful letters first for maximum pruning
3. Loose bounds using min/max available digits: cheap to compute, effective at pruning

## Files Modified
- `go/exercises/practice/alphametics/alphametics.go` (sole implementation file)

## Test Results
- 10/10 tests pass
- 0.003s total test time
- go vet clean

## Verdict
PASS - Ready for merge.
