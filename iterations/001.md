# Iteration 001 — Final

## Summary
Implemented the `Recite` function for the bottle-song exercise (Ten Green Bottles) in a single iteration. All 7 test cases pass.

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Goal phase**: Defined acceptance criteria and scope boundaries
2. **Design phase**: Debated two approaches (map+switch vs generalized), selected the generalized approach, reviewed and approved by codex
3. **Implementation phase**: Wrote the `Recite` function with `numberWord` and `bottleStr` helpers
4. **Verification**: All 7 test cases pass (`go test -v`)

## Files Modified
- `go/exercises/practice/bottle-song/bottle_song.go` — implemented solution

## Issues Encountered
- None. The exercise was straightforward with a clean test suite.

## Key Decision
- Chose the generalized single-code-path approach over special-casing individual verses, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Result
- Branch `issue-280` pushed to origin
- All acceptance criteria met
- Verdict: PASS
