# Iteration 001 — Final

## Summary

Successfully implemented the Go matrix exercise in a single iteration cycle.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal Phase**: Defined acceptance criteria and scope boundaries from issue #223
2. **Design Phase**: Generated 3 candidate plans, selected Branch 1 (Direct Slice-Based) as optimal. Plan reviewed and approved.
3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Implementer wrote `matrix.go` with `Matrix` type, `New`, `Rows`, `Cols`, `Set`
   - Challenger reviewed and approved — no issues found
   - Executor ran all tests: 35/35 pass, 3 benchmarks pass, no races, go vet clean
   - Verifier independently confirmed all acceptance criteria met: **PASS**

## Key Decisions

- Used `type Matrix [][]int` (named slice type) for nil-comparability with test suite
- Used `strings.Fields` for whitespace-tolerant parsing
- Added explicit empty-row check (`len(fields) == 0`) for robustness beyond reference solution
- `Rows()` and `Cols()` return deep copies via `make` + `copy`

## Files Modified

- `go/exercises/practice/matrix/matrix.go` — full implementation (67 lines)

## Test Results

- 35/35 unit tests pass
- 3/3 benchmarks pass
- No race conditions
- go vet clean

## Issues Encountered

None. Single iteration, clean pass.

## Commit

- `8b91c86` feat: implement matrix exercise solution
