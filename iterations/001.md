# Iteration 001: polyglot-go-alphametics

## Summary

Completed issue #13 in a single iteration cycle. The alphametics solver already existed from issue #4, but had two latent bugs that were identified and fixed.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope**: Defined acceptance criteria and scope boundaries in GOAL.md and SCOPE.md
2. **Design**: Identified two bugs in the existing implementation:
   - Incomplete leading-zero check (only checked answer word, not addend words)
   - Missing carry overflow validation in `isPuzzleSolution`
3. **Plan Review**: Plan agent reviewed and approved the design, also identified the carry overflow bug
4. **Implementation**: Implementer fixed both bugs:
   - Added `leadingLetters` field to track all multi-digit word leading letters
   - Replaced single answer-only check with comprehensive loop over all leading letters
   - Changed `return true` to `return carry == 0` in `isPuzzleSolution`
5. **Challenger Review**: PASS - All changes correct, match plan, no regressions
6. **Executor**: Build, vet, and all 10 tests pass (1.2s total)
7. **Verifier**: PASS - All 11 acceptance criteria verified independently

## Commit

- `fbebfed` - fix: add comprehensive leading-zero check and carry overflow validation for alphametics

## Branch

- `issue-13` pushed to origin

## Issues Encountered

None. Single iteration was sufficient.

## Test Results

All 10 test cases pass, including the 199-addend performance test (0.4s).
