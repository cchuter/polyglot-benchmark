# Iteration 001

## Summary

Completed the full implementation of the `matrix` exercise (issue #351) in a single iteration.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal Phase**: Analyzed the issue requirements and test file to define clear acceptance criteria and scope boundaries.
2. **Design Phase**: Debated two approaches (named slice type vs interface), selected the simpler named slice approach after structured evaluation. Codex review confirmed the plan with no blocking issues.
3. **Implementation Phase**: Wrote the solution in `matrix.go` with 4 functions:
   - `New` — parses string input with full validation
   - `Rows` — returns deep copy of rows
   - `Cols` — returns deep copy of columns (transposed)
   - `Set` — sets element with bounds checking
4. **Verification**: All tests pass, `go vet` clean.
5. **Convergence**: Committed and pushed to `issue-351` branch.

## Issues Encountered

None. The implementation was straightforward once the correct type design (`type Matrix [][]int`) was identified.

## Next Steps

- Create PR against `main` branch
