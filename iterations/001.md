# Iteration 001 — Beer Song Implementation

## Date
2026-02-16

## Summary
Single-iteration implementation of the beer-song Go exercise. All acceptance criteria met on first pass.

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Goal Phase**: Defined GOAL.md and SCOPE.md from issue #191
2. **Design Phase**: Generated 3 plan branches, selected Branch 1 (direct case-based approach), verified plan correctness through detailed trace review
3. **Implementation Phase**: Team of 4 agents (implementer, challenger, executor, verifier) executed sequentially:
   - Implementer wrote `beer_song.go` with `Verse()`, `Verses()`, and `Song()` functions
   - Challenger reviewed and found no issues
   - Executor ran all tests: 12/12 pass, benchmarks pass, go vet clean
   - Verifier confirmed all 11 acceptance criteria met — **PASS**
4. **Convergence**: Pushed `issue-191` branch to origin

## Files Modified
