# Iteration 001: Bowling Exercise Complete

## Accomplished
- Analyzed the bowling exercise requirements from issue #241
- Reviewed test cases (31 total: 10 Roll, 21 Score)
- Evaluated 3 design approaches, selected array-based roll tracking
- Implemented `bowling.go` with full Game struct, Roll(), and Score() methods
- All 31 tests pass, `go vet` clean
- Pushed feature branch `issue-241` to origin

## Issues Encountered
- No codex agent available in tmux environment for plan review; performed self-review instead
- No issues with implementation; all tests passed on first run

## Next Steps
- Create PR for merge into main
