# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## What was accomplished
- Defined goal and scope for pig-latin exercise (Phase 1)
- Debated regex vs iterative approaches; selected iterative string-scanning (Phase 2)
- Codex review identified a bounds-check bug in `word[:2]` access; fixed in plan and implementation
- Implemented `Sentence()` function with all four Pig Latin rules (Phase 3)
- All 22 test cases pass, `go vet` clean
- Pushed `issue-359` branch to origin

## Issues encountered
- The initial plan had a latent panic for single-character consonant words (`word[:2]` out of bounds). Caught during plan review and fixed before implementation.

## Final state
- Branch: `issue-359` pushed to origin
- Commit: `ae0f886` - "Implement pig-latin Sentence function"
- Tests: 22/22 passing
- Status: Done
