# Iteration 001

## Summary
Completed full implementation of the hexadecimal exercise (issue #343) in a single iteration.

## What Was Accomplished
1. Defined goal and scope (GOAL.md, SCOPE.md)
2. Designed implementation via structured debate (Proposal A vs B), selected Proposal A (reference-based approach with ParseError struct)
3. Obtained plan review — approved with no blocking issues
4. Implemented `ParseHex` and `HandleErrors` in `hexadecimal.go`
5. All tests pass, go vet clean
6. Committed and pushed to `issue-343` branch

## Issues Encountered
None. The exercise was straightforward with a clear reference solution.

## Key Decision
Used the canonical Exercism reference solution approach with `ParseError` struct and `goto` error pattern (derived from Go's `strconv` package) rather than a simpler `fmt.Errorf` approach. The structured error type enables type-safe error classification in `HandleErrors`.
