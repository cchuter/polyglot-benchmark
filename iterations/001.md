# Iteration 001 — Final

## Summary
Implemented the `ParseOctal` function for issue #225 (polyglot-go-octal) in a single iteration cycle.

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Goal & Scope** — Defined acceptance criteria (5 test cases + benchmark) and scope boundaries
2. **Design** — Evaluated 3 branches (minimal, extensible, performance); selected Branch 1 (minimal) for simplicity and readability
3. **Plan Review** — Codex reviewed and approved the plan with no changes needed
4. **Implementation** — Wrote `ParseOctal` using Horner's method: iterate characters, validate 0-7, accumulate `num*8 + digit`
5. **Code Review** — Challenger verified correctness, error handling, no built-in conversion usage
6. **Testing** — All 5 test cases pass, benchmark runs at 470.1 ns/op
7. **Verification** — All 7 acceptance criteria and 5 constraints verified as PASS

## Files Modified
- `go/exercises/practice/octal/octal.go` — implemented `ParseOctal(string) (int64, error)`
