# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Date: 2026-02-16

## Summary
Successfully implemented the `Cost` function for the book-store exercise (Issue #107) in a single iteration.

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Goal phase**: Analyzed the issue, created GOAL.md and SCOPE.md with acceptance criteria
2. **Design phase**: Wrote implementation plan using greedy grouping with 5+3→4+4 redistribution algorithm. Plan reviewed and approved.
3. **Implementation phase**: Team of 4 agents (implementer, challenger, executor, verifier) executed the plan:
   - Implementer wrote the `Cost` function in `book_store.go`
   - Challenger reviewed the code — PASS, no issues found
   - Executor ran build, tests, and vet — all 18/18 tests PASS
   - Verifier confirmed all acceptance criteria met — PASS verdict

## Key Decisions
- Used greedy grouping algorithm with 5+3→4+4 redistribution (proven optimal for this discount structure)
- Included custom `min` helper for Go 1.18 compatibility
- Cost redistribution applied as arithmetic adjustment (subtract 40 cents per pair) rather than group mutation

## Files Modified
- `go/exercises/practice/book-store/book_store.go` — Implemented `Cost` function (66 lines)

## Test Results
- 18/18 test cases pass
- `go build` clean
- `go vet` clean

## Issues Encountered
- None. Single iteration to success.

## Next Steps
- Push feature branch (done)
- Update status to done
