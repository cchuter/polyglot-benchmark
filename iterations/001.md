# Iteration 001 — Book Store Implementation

## Date: 2026-02-16

## Summary

Successfully implemented the `Cost` function for the book-store exercise in a single iteration cycle.

## What was accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope** — Defined problem statement, acceptance criteria, and scope boundaries
2. **Design** — Generated 3 candidate approaches (Greedy+Adjustment, Recursive, Frequency DP), selected Greedy+Adjustment as simplest and most efficient. Plan approved by codex review.
3. **Implementation** — Implementer wrote the `Cost` function using greedy layer-peeling with 5+3→4+4 adjustment. 46 lines of clean Go code.
4. **Review** — Challenger reviewed code for correctness, edge cases, and code quality. Verdict: PASS.
5. **Testing** — Executor ran `go vet` (clean) and `go test -v` (all 18 tests pass).
6. **Verification** — Verifier independently confirmed all 5 acceptance criteria met. Verdict: PASS.

## Algorithm

- Count frequency of each book title (1-5)
- Sort frequencies descending
- Layer-peel to determine group sizes
- Apply 5+3→4+4 adjustment (the only profitable conversion for this discount structure)
- Sum group costs using pre-computed cost table

## Issues encountered

None. Single iteration was sufficient.
