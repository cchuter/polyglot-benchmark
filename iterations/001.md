# Iteration 001 — Beer Song Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the beer-song Go exercise in a single iteration cycle.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal Phase**: Defined acceptance criteria and scope boundaries
2. **Design Phase**: Proposed two approaches (switch-case vs template-based), selected switch-case via structured debate. Plan review identified a critical bug (strings.Join missing trailing newline), which was fixed before implementation.
3. **Implementation Phase**: Team of 4 agents executed sequentially:
   - Implementer wrote the solution following the revised plan
   - Challenger reviewed and confirmed correctness
   - Executor ran all tests — 12/12 passed, go vet clean
   - Verifier independently confirmed all acceptance criteria met

## Key Decision

Used `bytes.Buffer` with explicit `\n` after each verse instead of `strings.Join`, because the test expectations include a trailing newline after the last verse.

## Issues Encountered

- Plan review caught the `strings.Join` vs `bytes.Buffer` discrepancy before implementation, preventing a test failure.
- No tmux codex agent available; used Task agent for plan review instead.

## Files Modified

- `go/exercises/practice/beer-song/beer_song.go` — full implementation

## Result

**PASS** — All tests pass, all acceptance criteria met.
