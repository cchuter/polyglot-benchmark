# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Accomplished
- Defined goal and scope for markdown parser exercise (Issue #264)
- Designed 3 candidate plans; selected Branch 1 (Clean Imperative)
- Implemented `Render` function in `markdown.go` with helpers `headingLevel` and `renderInline`
- All 17 test cases pass, `go vet` clean
- Pushed feature branch `issue-264` to origin

## Issues Encountered
- No codex agent available in tmux for plan review; performed self-review instead
- No issues with the implementation; all tests passed on first run

## Key Decisions
- Used `inList` boolean flag (vs. accumulating items in a slice) for cleaner list state management
- Used `strings.HasPrefix` for list detection instead of direct character indexing
- Processed bold (`__`) before italic (`_`) to prevent conflicts

## Files Modified
- `go/exercises/practice/markdown/markdown.go` — full solution (73 lines)

## Next Steps
- None — all acceptance criteria met, branch pushed
