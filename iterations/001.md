# Iteration 001

## Summary

Implemented the bottle-song exercise for Go (issue #239).

## Accomplished

1. Read and understood the exercise: generate "Ten Green Bottles" song lyrics
2. Analyzed test cases in `cases_test.go` — 7 tests covering single verses, edge cases (1 bottle, 2 bottles), and multi-verse generation
3. Designed 3 candidate approaches, selected simplest (lookup table + helpers)
4. Implemented `Recite` function in `bottle_song.go`
5. All 7 tests pass, `go vet` clean
6. Committed solution to `issue-239` branch

## Issues Encountered

- None. The exercise was straightforward.

## Key Decisions

- Used a simple slice for number-to-word mapping (only 0-10 needed)
- No error handling for out-of-range inputs (not tested)
- Kept helpers unexported since they're internal to the package

## Next Steps

- Push branch to origin
- Finalize convergence artifacts
