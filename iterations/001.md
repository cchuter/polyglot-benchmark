# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Summary

Single iteration to implement the Kindergarten Garden Go exercise. All acceptance criteria met on first pass.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope** (Phase 1): Defined acceptance criteria and scope boundaries in GOAL.md and SCOPE.md
2. **Design** (Phase 2): Wrote implementation plan in plan.md, self-reviewed (no codex agent available)
3. **Implementation** (Phase 3): Team of 4 agents executed sequentially:
   - **Implementer**: Wrote `kindergarten_garden.go` with `Garden` type, `NewGarden` constructor, and `Plants` method
   - **Challenger**: Reviewed implementation against all test cases - found no issues
   - **Executor**: Ran build, tests (14/14 pass), and benchmarks (2/2 pass)
   - **Verifier**: Independently confirmed all acceptance criteria met - **PASS** verdict

## Key Decisions

- `Garden` type defined as `map[string][]string` for simple child-to-plants lookup
- Children slice copied before sorting to avoid mutating input
- Duplicate name detection via map size vs slice length comparison
- Used `for cx := range rows[1:]` idiom as a 0..1 iterator for cup positions

## Files Modified

- `go/exercises/practice/kindergarten-garden/kindergarten_garden.go` - Full implementation

## Test Results

- 14/14 tests PASS
- 2/2 benchmarks PASS
- BenchmarkNewGarden: ~13,500 ns/op
- BenchmarkGarden_Plants: ~105 ns/op

## Issues Encountered

None. Implementation passed all tests on first attempt.
