# Iteration 001 - Beer Song Implementation

## Summary

Single iteration to implement the Go beer-song exercise. All tasks completed successfully on the first pass.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Implementation**: Replaced stub functions in `go/exercises/practice/beer-song/beer_song.go` with a working solution implementing `Verse()`, `Verses()`, and `Song()`.
2. **Code Review**: Challenger confirmed implementation is identical to the reference solution and handles all edge cases.
3. **Testing**: All 12 test cases passed (6 Verse tests, 5 Verses tests, 1 Song test). Build succeeded with no errors.
4. **Verification**: Verifier independently confirmed all acceptance criteria from GOAL.md are met.

## Pipeline

```
Implementer → wrote code, committed (fb4a5f3)
Challenger  → reviewed, PASS (identical to reference)
Executor    → build + test, ALL PASS (12/12)
Verifier    → acceptance criteria, PASS
```

## Issues Encountered

None. The implementation matched the reference solution exactly.

## Final Verdict

**PASS** - All acceptance criteria met on iteration 1.
