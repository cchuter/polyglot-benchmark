# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Summary

Implemented the connect (Hex) exercise in Go using a BFS-based approach. All 10 test cases pass, benchmarks run cleanly, and go vet reports no issues.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope** (Phase 1): Defined clear acceptance criteria and scope boundaries
2. **Design** (Phase 2): Evaluated 3 approaches (recursive DFS with bitflags, BFS with visited set, union-find). Selected BFS with visited set for simplicity and correctness.
3. **Implementation** (Phase 3): Team of 4 agents executed sequentially:
   - Implementer wrote the BFS solution to `connect.go`
   - Challenger reviewed for correctness — PASS
   - Executor ran tests — 10/10 PASS, benchmark PASS, go vet clean
   - Verifier independently confirmed all acceptance criteria — PASS
4. **Convergence** (Phase 4): Pushed `issue-199` branch to origin

## Solution Overview

The solution uses BFS (breadth-first search) with a `map[point]bool` visited set:
- `ResultOf(lines []string) (string, error)` — main exported function
- `hasWon(lines []string, player byte) bool` — BFS from starting edge to target edge
- `neighbors(p point, rows, cols int) []point` — 6-directional hex neighbor generation
- Player X: left-to-right (col 0 → col N-1)
- Player O: top-to-bottom (row 0 → row N-1)

## Files Modified

- `go/exercises/practice/connect/connect.go` — full implementation (73 lines)

## Test Results

- 10/10 test cases: PASS
- Benchmark: 36,735 iterations @ 35,760 ns/op
- go vet: clean

## Issues Encountered

None. Single iteration was sufficient.
