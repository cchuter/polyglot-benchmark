# Iteration 001 — Final

## Summary
Single iteration to implement the paasio Go exercise (Issue #227). All acceptance criteria met on the first pass.

## What Was Accomplished
- Implemented `paasio.go` with thread-safe IO statistics wrappers
- Three constructor functions: `NewReadCounter`, `NewWriteCounter`, `NewReadWriteCounter`
- Shared `counter` struct with `sync.Mutex` for concurrent-safe byte/ops tracking
- All 13 tests pass (`go test -cpu 2 -v ./...`)

## Team Cycle
1. **Implementer**: Wrote the solution, committed
2. **Challenger**: Reviewed code — PASS (correctness, thread safety, interface compliance, Go 1.18 compat)
3. **Executor**: Built and ran tests — 13/13 PASS
4. **Verifier**: Independently verified all 7 acceptance criteria — PASS

## Issues Encountered
None. The implementation matched the reference solution pattern exactly.
