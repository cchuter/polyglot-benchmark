# Iteration 001 - Final

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive test suite for the Go counter exercise (issue #115) in a single iteration cycle.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope** (Phase 1): Analyzed 4 counter implementations to identify bugs:
   - Impl1: Wrong line counting (counts `\n` only, no +1 for last line)
   - Impl2: ASCII-only letter detection (misses Unicode)
   - Impl3: Byte iteration instead of rune iteration (wrong counts for multi-byte UTF-8)
   - Impl4: Correct implementation

2. **Design** (Phase 2): Planned 9 test functions with a helper. Self-reviewed and fixed a bug in expected values (TestMultipleAddStrings Characters: 12→11).

3. **Implementation** (Phase 3): Team executed one cycle:
   - Implementer wrote counter_test.go with 9 tests + assertCounts helper
   - Challenger reviewed: all expected values verified correct
   - Executor ran tests against all 4 implementations:
     - IMPL=4: 9/9 PASS
     - IMPL=1: 4/9 FAIL (line counting)
     - IMPL=2: 1/9 FAIL (Unicode letters)
     - IMPL=3: 1/9 FAIL (byte iteration characters)
   - Verifier: PASS on all 7 acceptance criteria

4. **Convergence** (Phase 4): Pushed branch `issue-115` to origin.

## Issues Encountered

- No external codex agent available for plan review; performed thorough self-review instead
- Found and fixed incorrect expected value during design review (Characters=12→11 in TestMultipleAddStrings)

## Files Modified

- `go/exercises/practice/counter/counter_test.go` — Full test suite (9 tests + helper)

## Commit

- `4b61af3` - Add comprehensive test suite for counter exercise
