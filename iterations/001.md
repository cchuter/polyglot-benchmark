# Iteration 001: Forth Evaluator Implementation

## Summary
Implemented a complete Forth evaluator for issue #341 in a single iteration.

## What was accomplished
1. **Goal phase**: Defined clear acceptance criteria (9 items) and scope boundaries
2. **Design phase**: Evaluated two approaches (compiled operator list vs direct interpretation), selected the compiled approach for its correct snapshot semantics
3. **Implementation**: Wrote ~220 lines of Go implementing the full Forth evaluator
4. **Verification**: All 48 tests pass, `go vet` clean
5. **Convergence**: Committed and pushed to `issue-341` branch

## Issues encountered
- None. The implementation worked correctly on the first attempt.

## Key decisions
- Used compiled operator list approach (matching the reference solution architecture)
- Operator IDs used only for detecting `:` and `;` markers during parsing
- User-defined words stored as pre-resolved operator lists for snapshot semantics

## Result
All acceptance criteria met. Branch pushed to origin.
