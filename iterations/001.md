# Iteration 001

## Summary

Implemented the D&D character generator exercise in Go. Single iteration — all acceptance criteria met on first attempt.

## What Was Accomplished

1. Read and analyzed the exercise requirements from `goal.json` and test files
2. Wrote GOAL.md and SCOPE.md defining acceptance criteria and boundaries
3. Designed implementation plan in plan.md
4. Implemented solution in `dnd_character.go`:
   - `Character` struct with 6 ability scores + hitpoints
   - `Modifier()` function using `math.Floor` for correct negative rounding
   - `Ability()` function rolling 4d6, dropping lowest via manual min tracking
   - `GenerateCharacter()` wiring it all together
5. All tests pass (18 test cases across 3 test functions)
6. `go vet` clean

## Issues Encountered

None. Straightforward exercise with clear requirements.

## Key Decisions

- Used manual min tracking in `Ability()` instead of `slices.Min` to maintain compatibility with the `go 1.18` module declaration
- Used `math.Floor` instead of integer division for `Modifier()` to correctly handle negative values (floor division vs truncation toward zero)
