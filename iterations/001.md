# Iteration 001 — Final

## Summary
Successfully implemented the beer-song Go exercise in a single iteration cycle.

## What Was Accomplished
- Implemented `Verse()`, `Verses()`, and `Song()` in `go/exercises/practice/beer-song/beer_song.go`
- All 12 tests pass (6 verse tests, 5 multi-verse tests, 1 full song test)
- Code reviewed by challenger — no issues found
- Verified by independent verifier — PASS verdict
- Feature branch `issue-105` pushed to origin

## Team Cycle
1. **Implementer**: Wrote the solution and committed (`8614872`)
2. **Challenger**: Reviewed code — no issues, all edge cases handled correctly
3. **Executor**: Ran `go vet` and `go test -v` — all pass, no warnings
4. **Verifier**: Independently confirmed all 8 acceptance criteria met — PASS

## Issues Encountered
None. The implementation was straightforward and passed all tests on the first attempt.

## Key Decisions
- Used `strings.Builder` for efficient concatenation in `Verses()`
- Handled 4 cases in `Verse()`: 0, 1, 2, and default (3-99)
- Appended `\n` after every verse in `Verses()` (including last) to match test expectations
