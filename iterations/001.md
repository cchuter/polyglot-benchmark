# Iteration 001: Beer Song Implementation

## Summary
Single-iteration implementation of the beer-song Go exercise (Issue #82). All acceptance criteria met on the first pass.

## What Was Accomplished
- Implemented `Verse`, `Verses`, and `Song` functions in `go/exercises/practice/beer-song/beer_song.go`
- All 12 unit tests pass
- Both benchmarks run successfully
- Code compiles cleanly with `go vet` producing no warnings

## Team Cycle
1. **Implementer**: Wrote complete implementation following the plan and reference solution. Committed as `a451042`.
2. **Challenger**: Reviewed code for correctness, edge cases, and plan adherence. Verdict: PASS. Minor style notes (Yoda conditions, named return) but no functional issues.
3. **Executor**: Ran `go test -v` (12/12 pass) and `go test -bench=.` (both benchmarks pass). ~5μs/op for Verses, ~63μs/op for Song.
4. **Verifier**: Independently confirmed all 8 acceptance criteria met. Verdict: PASS.

## Issues Encountered
None. Clean first-pass implementation.

## Key Decisions
- Used switch-based dispatch for verse special cases (n=0,1,2,default) matching the reference implementation
- Used `bytes.Buffer` for efficient multi-verse concatenation
- Kept implementation in a single file following repository conventions

## Branch
`issue-82` pushed to origin. Commit: `a451042`.
