# Iteration 001: D&D Character Generator

## Accomplished
- Analyzed the exercise requirements from issue #333 and test files
- Defined goal, scope, and implementation plan with structured debate
- Identified Go 1.18 compatibility constraint (rejected `slices` package)
- Implemented solution in `dnd_character.go`:
  - `Character` struct with 7 fields
  - `Modifier` function using `math.Floor` for correct floor division
  - `Ability` function using `sort.Ints` to drop lowest of 4d6
  - `GenerateCharacter` function composing all pieces
- All 16 modifier tests pass, ability range tests pass, character generation tests pass
- `go vet` clean
- Committed and pushed to `issue-333` branch

## Issues Encountered
- None. Straightforward implementation.

## Next Steps
