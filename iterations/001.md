# Iteration 001 — Forth Evaluator Implementation

## Date: 2026-02-16

## Summary

Successfully implemented a Forth evaluator in Go as a single iteration. All tests pass on first attempt.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope Definition**: Defined acceptance criteria (12 items) and scope boundaries for the Forth evaluator exercise.

2. **Design Phase**: Generated 3 candidate design branches:
   - Branch 1: Direct Interpreter with token expansion (selected)
   - Branch 2: Compiled Operator List with closures
   - Branch 3: Token-Stream with flat pre-expansion

   Selected Branch 1 for simplicity, minimal risk, and full alignment with acceptance criteria. Plan reviewed and approved.

3. **Implementation**: Implemented the Forth evaluator in `go/exercises/practice/forth/forth.go` (142 lines) using the Direct Interpreter with Token Expansion approach:
   - `Forth()` entry point iterating over input phrases
   - `eval()` processing tokens with lookup order: defs → number → built-in → error
   - User-defined words with snapshot semantics via eager token expansion
   - Case insensitivity via `strings.ToUpper`
   - Full error handling for all edge cases

4. **Review**: Challenger performed adversarial review — no issues found.

5. **Testing**: All 46 tests pass (0 failures, 0.005s runtime).

6. **Verification**: Independent verifier confirmed all 12 acceptance criteria met. Verdict: PASS.

## Issues Encountered

None. Clean first-iteration success.
