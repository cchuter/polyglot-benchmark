# Iteration 001 — Final

## Summary

Single iteration was sufficient. The paasio exercise was implemented, reviewed, tested, and verified in one cycle.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope** — Defined acceptance criteria: implement `NewReadCounter`, `NewWriteCounter`, `NewReadWriteCounter` with thread-safe counting via `sync.Mutex`.
2. **Design** — Evaluated mutex-based (Proposal A) vs atomic-based (Proposal B) approaches. Selected mutex-based for correctness (atomics fail consistency tests). Plan reviewed and approved.
3. **Implementation** — Wrote `paasio.go` with:
   - Shared `counter` struct with `sync.Mutex` for atomic bytes+ops updates
   - `readCounter` wrapping `io.Reader` with byte/op tracking
   - `writeCounter` wrapping `io.Writer` with byte/op tracking
   - `rwCounter` composing both via interface embedding
4. **Review** — Challenger confirmed code matches plan, mutex usage correct, all edge cases handled.
5. **Testing** — Executor ran `go test -v -cpu 2 -race ./...`: 13/13 tests pass, no races.
6. **Verification** — Verifier independently confirmed all 6 acceptance criteria met, re-ran tests, verified only `paasio.go` was modified.

## Issues Encountered

None. Implementation was straightforward and passed on first attempt.

## Files Modified

- `go/exercises/practice/paasio/paasio.go` — full implementation (75 lines)

## Branch

- `issue-311` pushed to origin
