# Iteration 001 — Final

## Summary
Single-iteration implementation of the alphametics puzzle solver for issue #69.

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Goal & Scope**: Defined clear acceptance criteria and scope boundaries
2. **Design**: Created plan for coefficient-based backtracking solver with partial-sum bounding; reviewed by subagent
3. **Implementation**: Wrote `Solve` function in `alphametics.go` (143 lines)
4. **Review**: Challenger review found no correctness issues
5. **Testing**: All 10 test cases pass in 5ms total; `go vet` clean
6. **Verification**: All acceptance criteria met — PASS verdict

## Approach
- Coefficient-based reduction: converts puzzle to a single weighted-sum equation
- Backtracking with digit-uniqueness enforcement
- Partial-sum bounding for early pruning
- Letters sorted by descending absolute coefficient for optimal search order

## Issues Encountered
- Initial implementer agent produced code with a runtime panic (index out of bounds in bounding function) and overly complex allocation-heavy bounding logic
- Lead took over implementation, simplified the bounding function to use a correct loose relaxation (0-9 range per coefficient), eliminating all bugs

## Key Metrics
- Tests: 10/10 PASS
- Runtime: 5ms total
- Lines of code: 143
- External dependencies: none (stdlib only)
