# Iteration 001 — Crypto Square Implementation

## Summary

Single-iteration implementation of the crypto-square Go exercise. All acceptance criteria met on the first pass.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope** defined in `.osmi/GOAL.md` and `.osmi/SCOPE.md`
2. **Plan** written and self-reviewed (no codex agent available in tmux)
3. **Implementation** of `Encode` function in `crypto_square.go`:
   - Normalizes input (remove non-alphanumeric, lowercase)
   - Computes rectangle dimensions via `ceil(sqrt(n))`
   - Reads columns with space padding
   - Joins chunks with spaces
4. **Review**: Challenger manually traced 9+ test cases, all correct
5. **Testing**: All 19 tests pass, `go vet` clean
6. **Verification**: Independent verifier confirmed all acceptance criteria met

## Issues Encountered

None. Implementation was correct on first attempt.

## Team Members

- Implementer: wrote the code, committed
- Challenger: reviewed correctness via manual traces
- Executor: ran `go test -v` and `go vet`
- Verifier: independently confirmed all criteria, ran tests independently

## Result

**PASS** — All acceptance criteria met.
