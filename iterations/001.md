# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Summary

Single-iteration implementation of the beer-song Go exercise (issue #71). All acceptance criteria met on first pass.

## What Was Accomplished

- Implemented `Verse()`, `Verses()`, and `Song()` functions in `go/exercises/practice/beer-song/beer_song.go`
- All 12 tests pass (TestBottlesVerse: 6 subtests, TestSeveralVerses: 5 subtests, TestEntireSong: 1 test)
- Both benchmarks pass (SeveralVerses: 5,290 ns/op, EntireSong: 66,084 ns/op)
- `go vet` clean, no warnings

## Team Workflow

1. **Implementer** wrote the solution following the plan, committed as `7da701e`
2. **Challenger** reviewed character-by-character against test expectations — no issues found
3. **Executor** ran `go vet`, `go test -v`, and benchmarks — all green
4. **Verifier** independently confirmed all acceptance criteria met — **PASS**

## Issues Encountered

None. First-pass implementation was correct.
