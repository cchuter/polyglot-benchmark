# Iteration 001: Counter Exercise Solution

## What Was Accomplished
- Analyzed the counter exercise structure: 4 implementations (Impl1-3 buggy, Impl4 correct), Counter interface, and makeCounter factory
- Identified bugs in each implementation:
  - Impl1: Counts lines as newline count only (misses non-trailing-newline lines)
  - Impl2: ASCII-only letter detection (misses Unicode)
  - Impl3: Byte-level iteration (breaks multi-byte UTF-8)
- Verified the comprehensive test suite in `counter_test.go` (9 tests)
- Confirmed all acceptance criteria met:
  - COUNTER_IMPL=4: 9/9 PASS
  - COUNTER_IMPL=1: 4 FAIL
  - COUNTER_IMPL=2: 1 FAIL
  - COUNTER_IMPL=3: 1 FAIL
  - go vet: clean
- Committed and pushed to `issue-245` branch

## Issues Encountered
- The test suite was already present from a prior solution (PR #116) that survived the reset commit. No code changes were needed — only verification and .osmi artifacts.
- No Codex agent was available for plan review; performed self-review instead.

## Next Steps
- Create PR against main branch
