# Iteration 001

## Summary

Single iteration to implement the bowling game scorer for issue #57.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal Phase**: Defined GOAL.md and SCOPE.md from issue requirements
2. **Design Phase**: Wrote implementation plan with roll-based storage and frame-by-frame scoring; self-reviewed (codex agent unavailable)
3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Created feature branch `issue-57`
   - Spawned implementation team with implementer agent
   - Implementer produced correct implementation in `go/exercises/practice/bowling/bowling.go`
   - All 31 tests pass (10 Roll + 21 Score)
   - Challenger review: no issues found
   - Verifier verdict: **PASS**

## Key Decisions

- Used flat `rolls` slice with frame tracking during Roll() and frame-walking during Score()
- Separated validation concerns (Roll) from scoring concerns (Score)
- 10th frame validation handles all edge cases: double strikes, strike+non-strike, spare, and open

## Test Results

- 31/31 tests pass
- Build compiles cleanly
- All 14 acceptance criteria met

## Next Steps

- Branch pushed to origin
- Ready for PR creation
