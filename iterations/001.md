# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the `Render` function for the Go Markdown parser exercise (issue #305) in a single iteration.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope** — Defined acceptance criteria (17 test cases, `Render` function signature, package markdown) and scope boundaries (only `markdown.go` modified, standard library only).

2. **Design** — Evaluated two proposals:
   - Proposal A: Line-by-line processor with string operations (selected)
   - Proposal B: Regex-based parser (rejected — more complex, inconsistent with codebase conventions)
   - Plan review identified two issues (fmt.Sprintf compilation error, ambiguous applyInline spec) which were resolved before implementation.

3. **Implementation** — Team of 4 agents executed sequentially:
   - **Implementer**: Wrote `markdown.go` with `Render`, `headerLevel`, `applyInline`, and `replaceMarker` functions
   - **Challenger**: Manually traced all 17 test cases — all PASS
   - **Executor**: Ran `go build`, `go test -v`, `go vet` — all clean, 17/17 tests pass
   - **Verifier**: Independently confirmed all acceptance criteria met — **PASS**

## Key Decisions

- Used `strings.Split` + `strings.Builder` approach (no regex)
- Bold (`__`) processed before italic (`_`) to prevent interference
- `replaceMarker` uses split-and-rejoin for alternating open/close tags
- Header level converted to string via `string(rune('0' + level))`

## Files Modified

- `go/exercises/practice/markdown/markdown.go` — full implementation (82 lines)

## Issues Encountered

- None. Single iteration, clean pass.
