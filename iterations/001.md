# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the `Recite` function for the bottle-song exercise (issue #65) in a single iteration.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope** defined: Implement `Recite(startBottles, takeDown int) []string` in `bottle_song.go`
2. **Plan** created and self-reviewed (no codex agent available in tmux)
3. **Implementation** by implementer agent:
   - Added `numberToWord` map (1-10)
   - Added `verse(n int) []string` helper with n==1, n==2, and default cases
   - Added `Recite` function with verse loop and blank-line separators
4. **Challenger review**: PASS — all edge cases handled correctly
5. **Executor test run**: All 7 test cases pass (`go test -v` exit code 0)
6. **Verifier audit**: PASS — all acceptance criteria independently confirmed

## Issues Encountered

None. The implementation matched the reference solution pattern and all tests passed on the first attempt.
