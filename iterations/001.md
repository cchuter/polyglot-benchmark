# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## What Was Accomplished

- Implemented `Entry` struct and `FormatLedger` function in `go/exercises/practice/ledger/ledger.go`
- Supports USD/EUR currencies and en-US/nl-NL locales
- Handles sorting by date, description, change amount
- Proper amount formatting with thousand separators, decimal separators, and locale-specific negative formatting
- Error handling for invalid currency, locale, and date inputs
- Immutability preserved (input entries slice not modified)

## Pipeline Results

1. **Implementer**: Wrote complete implementation in a single pass
2. **Challenger**: Traced through all 16 test cases, found no issues
3. **Executor**: All 16 tests pass, benchmark runs at ~32,814 ns/op
4. **Verifier**: PASS verdict — all acceptance criteria met

## Issues Encountered

- None. Single iteration was sufficient.

## Key Decision

- Used a hybrid approach: simple procedural style with switch statements, plus a clean `formatAmount` helper function
- No over-engineering with config structs — just straightforward code for 2 locales and 2 currencies

## Files Modified

- `go/exercises/practice/ledger/ledger.go` — complete implementation (137 lines)

## Commit

- `342df5c` — "Implement ledger exercise with Entry struct and FormatLedger function"
