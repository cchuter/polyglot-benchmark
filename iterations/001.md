# Iteration 001 — Final

## Summary

Implemented the `ParseOctal` function for the polyglot-go-octal exercise (issue #139) in a single iteration. All acceptance criteria met on the first pass.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope** — Defined clear acceptance criteria and scope boundaries in GOAL.md and SCOPE.md
2. **Design** — Wrote implementation plan with algorithm details; self-reviewed (no codex agent available)
3. **Implementation** — Team of 4 agents (implementer, challenger, executor, verifier) executed sequentially:
   - Implementer wrote the `ParseOctal` function in `octal.go` and committed
   - Challenger reviewed the code for correctness, edge cases, and plan adherence — PASS
   - Executor ran `go build`, `go test -v`, and `go vet` — all PASS
   - Verifier independently confirmed all 5 acceptance criteria — overall PASS
4. **Convergence** — Pushed branch `issue-139` to origin

## Files Modified

- `go/exercises/practice/octal/octal.go` — Implemented `ParseOctal` function

## Issues Encountered

None. The implementation was straightforward and passed all checks on the first iteration.

## Test Results

- `go build ./...` — PASS
- `go test -v ./...` — PASS (all 5 test cases)
- `go vet ./...` — PASS
