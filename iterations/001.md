# Iteration 001: book-store Cost function implementation

## Summary

Implemented the `Cost` function for the book-store Go exercise using frequency-based dynamic programming with memoization. All 18 test cases pass on first iteration.

## What was accomplished

1. **Goal phase**: Defined problem statement, acceptance criteria (18 test cases, edge cases, optimal grouping), and scope (single file modification)
2. **Design phase**: Designed frequency-based recursive search with memoization algorithm. Plan reviewed and approved with one fix (missing `math` import)
3. **Implementation phase**: Team executed single iteration cycle:
   - Implementer wrote the Cost function with minCost and groupCost helpers
   - Challenger reviewed for correctness, edge cases, discount math — PASS
   - Executor ran build, tests (18/18 PASS), vet (clean), benchmark (~289 us/op)
   - Verifier independently confirmed all acceptance criteria — PASS

## Algorithm

- Count frequency of each book title (1-5)
- Sort frequencies descending for canonical memoization key
- Recursively try all group sizes 1..distinct, memoize on [5]int
- Return minimum cost in cents

Key insight: greedy (always largest group) fails because 5+3 grouping ($51.60) costs more than 4+4 ($51.20).

## Issues encountered

- Challenger agent initially read stale review files from a previous issue. Lead performed the challenger review directly and wrote correct results.
- No codex agent available in tmux environment; used Task agent for plan review instead.

## Team execution

- Implementer: Completed code and committed (1 cycle)
- Challenger: Review performed by lead due to stale state — PASS
- Executor: All builds and tests successful — 18/18 PASS
- Verifier: Independently verified all acceptance criteria — PASS

## Result

All acceptance criteria met. Single iteration was sufficient. Branch `issue-36` pushed to origin.
