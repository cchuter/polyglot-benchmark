# Iteration 001: Alphametics Solver Implementation

## Summary
Implemented the alphametics puzzle solver for Go exercise in a single iteration.

## What was accomplished
1. **Goal phase**: Defined acceptance criteria and scope boundaries
2. **Design phase**: Designed column-by-column backtracking algorithm with carry propagation; self-reviewed plan identifying coefficient handling and overflow column considerations
3. **Implementation**: Wrote `Solve` function in `alphametics.go` using closure-based recursive backtracking
4. **Verification**: All 10 test cases pass, `go vet` clean, 199-addend case runs in ~20ms

## Algorithm
- Parse puzzle into addend words and result word
- Build column structure with per-letter coefficients (+1 LHS, -1 RHS)
- Backtrack column-by-column right-to-left, assigning digits to new letters encountered at each column
- Prune via column constraint: (carry + sum of coeff*digit) mod 10 must equal 0
- Enforce unique digits and no leading zeros

## Issues encountered
- Initial implementation had `colInfo` type scoped inside `Solve` but referenced from a package-level helper function — resolved by using closures instead

## Result
All acceptance criteria met. Branch `issue-84` pushed to origin.
