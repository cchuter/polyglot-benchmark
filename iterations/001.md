# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Accomplished
- Implemented alphametics puzzle solver in `go/exercises/practice/alphametics/alphametics.go`
- All 10 test cases pass (including 199-addend, 10-letter puzzle)
- `go vet` clean
- Pushed to `issue-147` branch

## Approach
- Permutation-based search following the reference implementation structure
- Column-by-column validation with carry propagation for early rejection
- Two improvements over the reference:
  1. Leading-zero check for all multi-digit words (not just result)
  2. Final carry == 0 verification after all columns

## Performance
- Total test runtime: ~1.1 seconds
- Largest test (199 addends, 10 letters): ~0.31 seconds

## Issues Encountered
- None. Implementation was straightforward following the reference pattern.

## Next Steps
- Create PR for merging into main
