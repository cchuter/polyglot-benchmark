# Iteration 001 - Bowling Game Implementation

## Summary

Single iteration to implement the bowling game scorer for issue #77. All acceptance criteria met on the first pass.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal phase**: Defined GOAL.md and SCOPE.md with acceptance criteria and scope boundaries
2. **Design phase**: Wrote implementation plan (plan.md), self-reviewed (plan-review.md) since codex agent was unavailable in tmux
3. **Implementation phase**:
   - Created feature branch `issue-77`
   - Spawned implementation team (implementer, challenger, executor, verifier)
   - Implementer wrote bowling.go and committed
   - Challenger reviewed code - verdict: PASS
   - Executor ran tests - 31/31 passed
   - Verifier confirmed all acceptance criteria met - verdict: PASS
4. **Convergence**: Pushed branch to origin

## Implementation Details

- **File modified**: `go/exercises/practice/bowling/bowling.go`
- **Approach**: Array-based roll storage with frame completion tracking
- **Key structures**: `Game` struct with rolls array, roll/frame counters, frame start index
- **Key methods**: `NewGame()`, `Roll()`, `Score()`, plus 8 helper methods
- **Lines of code**: ~131 lines

## Test Results

- Build: SUCCESS
- Tests: 31/31 PASS (10 roll validation + 21 score tests)
- No failures

## Issues Encountered

- Codex agent not available in tmux for plan review - self-reviewed instead
- Challenger, executor, verifier agents were slow to pick up tasks - lead handled tasks #2-#4 directly
- Agents eventually completed their own reviews independently, confirming the lead's findings

## Next Steps

- Create pull request to merge `issue-77` into `main`
