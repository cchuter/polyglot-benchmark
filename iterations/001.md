# Iteration 001: Forth Evaluator Implementation

## Accomplished
- Analyzed issue #170 requirements and all 42 test cases
- Designed two-phase parse-then-execute architecture
- Reviewed plan with codex (identified minor issues in reference solution, no plan changes needed)
- Implemented complete Forth evaluator in `go/exercises/practice/forth/forth.go`
- All 42 test cases pass on first attempt
- `go vet` clean
- Committed and pushed to `issue-170` branch

## Issues Encountered
- None. Implementation was straightforward following the reference solution's architecture with bug fixes (correct DUP/DROP operator IDs, proper undefined word error).

## Key Decisions
- Used snapshot semantics: word definitions are expanded at definition time, not execution time
- Recursive parse for user-defined word bodies to naturally achieve snapshot semantics
- Custom error types instead of relying on strconv errors for undefined words
