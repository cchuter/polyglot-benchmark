# Iteration 001 — Book Store Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the `Cost` function for the book-store exercise in a single iteration cycle.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope** — Defined acceptance criteria and scope boundaries for the book-store discount calculator
2. **Design** — Evaluated two approaches (greedy+fix vs DP), selected greedy with 5+3→4+4 optimization as the simpler, proven-correct solution
3. **Plan Review** — Codex review confirmed algorithmic correctness; identified two minor implementation fixes (Go 1.18 `min` compatibility, `sort` import)
4. **Implementation** — Implementer wrote the `Cost` function with:
   - Frequency counting for books 1-5
   - Greedy group formation (sort descending, take one from each non-zero)
   - 5+3 → 4+4 optimization (saves 40 cents per conversion)
   - Pre-computed price lookup table
   - Custom `minInt` helper for Go 1.18 compatibility
5. **Review** — Challenger traced through multiple test cases, confirmed correctness and Go 1.18 compatibility
6. **Testing** — All 18 test cases passed (`go test -v ./...`)
7. **Verification** — Independent verifier confirmed all acceptance criteria met, only `book_store.go` modified

## Issues Encountered

None. Single-iteration pass.

## Files Modified

- `go/exercises/practice/book-store/book_store.go` — Implemented `Cost` function (53 lines)

## Result

**PASS** — All 18 tests pass. Branch `issue-278` pushed to origin.
