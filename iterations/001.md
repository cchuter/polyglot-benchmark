# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Accomplished
- Defined goal and scope for issue #233 (alphametics solver)
- Designed 3 candidate approaches, selected coefficient reduction with backtracking
- Implemented the `Solve` function in `alphametics.go`
- All 10 test cases pass (including extreme 199-addend puzzle) in 5ms
- `go vet` reports no issues
- Committed on branch `issue-233`

## Key Decisions
- **Coefficient reduction** over brute-force permutation: reduces each puzzle to `sum(coeff * digit) == 0`, enabling efficient pruning
- **Backtracking with bounds pruning**: at each node, compute min/max possible remaining sum; prune if zero unreachable
- **Letter ordering by absolute coefficient**: ensures the most constrained letters are assigned first, maximizing pruning effectiveness

## Issues Encountered
- Initial implementation had a bug (`first = true` instead of `first = false` in bounds computation) — caught during code review before first test run
- Pruning bounds initially computed outside the digit loop (not accounting for the candidate digit being consumed) — moved inside for correctness

## Next Steps
- Push feature branch to origin
- Close issue #233
