# Iteration 001 — Forth Evaluator Implementation

## Accomplished
- Analyzed issue #256 requirements and defined goal/scope
- Designed 3 candidate approaches, selected operator-list pattern
- Implemented complete Forth evaluator in `go/exercises/practice/forth/forth.go`
- All 42 test cases pass, `go vet` clean
- Committed and pushed to `issue-256` branch

## Issues Encountered
- None. Implementation was clean on first attempt.

## Key Decisions
- Used operator-list approach (compile words to function lists at definition time) to naturally handle definition-time semantics
- Followed reference implementation pattern from `.meta/example.go`
- Fixed DUP/DROP operator ID swap that existed in the reference

## Next Steps
- Create pull request from `issue-256` to `main`
