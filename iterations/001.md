# Iteration 001: Bowling Exercise Implementation

## Date
2026-02-15

## What Was Accomplished
- Implemented the Go bowling game scorer in `go/exercises/practice/bowling/bowling.go`
- Defined `Game` struct with `rolls []int`, `currentFrame int`, `currentBall int`, `done bool`
- Implemented `NewGame()`, `Roll(pins int) error`, and `Score() (int, error)`
- Full validation for normal frames (0-8) and 10th frame with bonus rolls
- Frame-walking scoring algorithm for strikes, spares, and open frames

## Team Pipeline Results
1. **Implementer**: Wrote complete implementation, committed as `0928bb7`
2. **Challenger**: Reviewed code — no issues found, all edge cases handled correctly
3. **Executor**: Ran `go test -v` — all 31 tests pass (21 scoring + 10 roll validation)
4. **Verifier**: Independent audit — **PASS** verdict, all acceptance criteria met

## Issues Encountered
- None. Single iteration was sufficient — implementation was correct on first pass.

## Key Decisions
- Used flat `[]int` slice for rolls with frame-walking for scoring (standard approach)
- Tracked 10th frame state via `currentBall` counter (0, 1, 2) within frame 9
- Pin reset logic in 10th frame: after strike, pins reset; after non-strike, remaining pins tracked for validation

## Result
- Feature branch `issue-11` pushed to origin
- All 31 tests pass
- Only `bowling.go` modified (no test files or go.mod changed)
