# Iteration 001 — Complete

## Summary
Implemented the D&D character generator exercise in Go. Single iteration — all acceptance criteria passed on first attempt.

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Goal & Scope**: Defined acceptance criteria and scope boundaries
2. **Design**: Evaluated 3 approaches, selected Branch 1 (direct min-tracking), plan reviewed and approved
3. **Implementation**: Wrote `dnd_character.go` with `Character` struct, `Modifier`, `Ability`, and `GenerateCharacter`
4. **Review**: Challenger verified correctness of all functions, including floor division edge cases
5. **Testing**: All 18 test subtests pass, all 3 benchmarks pass
6. **Verification**: All 6 acceptance criteria confirmed met

## Key Decisions
- Used `math.Floor` for modifier calculation (correct floor division for negative odd scores)
- Used min-tracking (init=7) instead of `slices.Min` (Go 1.18 compatibility)
- Avoided unnecessary `dice` slice allocation per plan review recommendation

## Files Modified
- `go/exercises/practice/dnd-character/dnd_character.go` — complete implementation (49 lines)

## Issues Encountered
- Verifier agent became unresponsive; team lead completed verification directly
- No code issues encountered

## Result
**PASS** — All tests pass, branch pushed to origin as `issue-205`
