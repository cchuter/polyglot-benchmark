# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Summary
Implemented the `Use` function for the Go error-handling exercise (issue #293) in a single iteration cycle.

## What Was Accomplished
- **Goal & Scope**: Defined clear acceptance criteria and scope boundaries
- **Design**: Evaluated two approaches (two-defer vs single-defer pattern) via structured debate. The two-defer pattern with named return values was selected as the winner due to correctness, idiom compliance, and simplicity.
- **Implementation**: Wrote the `Use` function in `error_handling.go` (~25 lines)
- **Review**: Challenger confirmed correctness of defer ordering, error propagation, and type assertion safety
- **Testing**: All 5 tests pass (0.004s)
- **Verification**: Independent verifier confirmed all acceptance criteria met

## Team Pipeline Results
| Role | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| Implementer | Code written and committed |
| Challenger | PASS — no issues found |
| Executor | PASS — 5/5 tests pass |
| Verifier | PASS — all acceptance criteria met |

## Key Decisions
- Used named return value `(err error)` for error propagation from deferred recover handler
- Two separate defers (Close + recover) leveraging LIFO ordering to guarantee Defrob-before-Close
- Infinite retry loop for `TransientError` with type assertion
- Simplified over reference implementation by removing dead code after `Frob` call

## Files Modified
- `go/exercises/practice/error-handling/error_handling.go`

## Issues Encountered
None. Single iteration was sufficient.
