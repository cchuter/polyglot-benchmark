# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Summary
Single iteration to implement the Go ledger formatter exercise (Issue #219).

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Goal & Scope** defined in `.osmi/GOAL.md` and `.osmi/SCOPE.md`
2. **Design** completed with 3 candidate branches; Branch 1 (simplicity-first) selected
3. **Implementation** of `ledger.go` with:
   - `Entry` struct (Date, Description, Change)
   - `FormatLedger` function supporting en-US and nl-NL locales, USD and EUR currencies

   - Input slice immutability (copy before sort)
4. **Review** by challenger: PASS — all acceptance criteria met, no issues found
5. **Testing** by executor: 17/17 tests pass, go vet clean, benchmark ~37μs/op
6. **Verification** by verifier: PASS — independent confirmation of all criteria

## Issues Encountered
