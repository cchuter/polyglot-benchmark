# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Accomplished
- Analyzed exercise requirements from issue #166 and test suite
- Defined goal, scope, and implementation plan
- Obtained codex review (8.5/10, no blocking issues)
- Implemented `Use` function in `error_handling.go`
- All 5 tests pass, `go vet` clean
- Committed and pushed to `issue-166` branch

## Solution Summary
The `Use` function uses Go's defer/panic/recover pattern:
1. Retry loop handles `TransientError` from opener
2. `defer r.Close()` guarantees cleanup
3. Deferred recover handler catches panics from `Frob`, calls `Defrob` for `FrobError`
4. Named return value `err` allows recover handler to set the return error

## Issues Encountered
- None. Straightforward implementation matching the reference pattern.
