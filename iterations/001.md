# Iteration 001 — bottle-song Implementation

## Summary
Implemented the `Recite` function for the Go bottle-song exercise in a single iteration cycle. All 7 tests pass. Verifier verdict: **PASS**.

## Phases
1. **Goal**: Defined acceptance criteria — implement `Recite(startBottles, takeDown int) []string` that generates "Ten Green Bottles" lyrics
2. **Design**: Created implementation plan with number-to-word map, title-casing, singular/plural handling, verse generation and multi-verse assembly
3. **Implementation**: Team of 4 agents (implementer, challenger, executor, verifier) executed one iteration cycle:
   - Implementer wrote the code and committed
   - Challenger traced through all 7 test cases — no issues found
   - Executor ran `go test -v` — 7/7 tests PASS
   - Verifier confirmed all acceptance criteria met — **PASS**
4. **Convergence**: Pushed `issue-109` branch to origin

## Files Modified
- `go/exercises/practice/bottle-song/bottle_song.go` — full implementation

## Issues Encountered
None. Single iteration was sufficient.

## Key Decisions
- Used inline `titleCase` function (`strings.ToUpper(word[:1]) + word[1:]`) instead of deprecated `strings.Title`
- Used a `bottleStr(n)` helper for singular/plural instead of hardcoded switch cases
- Generalized the `verse` function to handle all cases uniformly via `fmt.Sprintf`
