# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## What Was Accomplished

- Implemented the bowling game scorer in `go/exercises/practice/bowling/bowling.go`
- Architecture: Roll-array with frame tracking (fixed-size `[21]int` array, frame counter, frame-start index)
- All 31 tests pass (10 roll validation + 21 scoring)
- Single commit: `f0b30ba Implement bowling game scorer`
- Feature branch `issue-282` pushed to origin

## Team Execution

1. **Implementer**: Wrote the full implementation following the approved plan. Committed cleanly.
2. **Challenger**: Reviewed the code, traced all edge cases manually. Verdict: APPROVE.
3. **Executor**: Ran `go test -v ./...` — all 31/31 tests pass.
4. **Verifier**: Independently confirmed all tests pass, only `bowling.go` modified, API conformance verified. Verdict: **PASS**.

## Issues Encountered

- None. Single iteration was sufficient — the plan was well-aligned with the reference solution architecture.

## Key Design Decisions

- Used the roll-array approach (Proposal A) over the post-hoc analysis approach (Proposal B) for proven correctness and consistency with codebase conventions.
- Error variable names and messages match test expectations exactly.
- Helper methods keep the Roll() and Score() logic clean and readable.
