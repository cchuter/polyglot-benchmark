# Iteration 001 — Final

## Summary
Single iteration to implement the hexadecimal exercise. All acceptance criteria met on first pass.

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Goal & Scope**: Defined clear acceptance criteria and scope boundaries for the hexadecimal converter exercise.
2. **Design**: Conducted structured debate between two approaches (structured error types vs. simple fmt.Errorf). Selected Proposal A (structured errors with ParseError type and goto flow) for its robustness and consistency with Go stdlib patterns. Plan reviewed and approved by codex.
3. **Implementation**: Implementer wrote `ParseHex` and `HandleErrors` in `hexadecimal.go` following the plan exactly. Committed as ccfbeff.
4. **Review**: Challenger performed adversarial review — no issues found. Implementation matches reference solution.
5. **Testing**: Executor ran build, unit tests, and benchmarks — all passed. TestParseHex PASS, TestHandleErrors PASS, BenchmarkParseHex ~452 ns/op.
6. **Verification**: Verifier independently confirmed all 6 acceptance criteria met. Verdict: PASS.
7. **Convergence**: Feature branch `issue-299` pushed to origin.

## Issues Encountered
None. Clean single-iteration completion.

## Key Decisions
- Used structured `ParseError` type wrapping sentinel errors (`ErrRange`, `ErrSyntax`) rather than simple `fmt.Errorf`
- Used `goto` for error flow control, consistent with Go's `strconv` package patterns
- Two-stage overflow detection: pre-multiplication threshold check + post-addition wrap-around check
