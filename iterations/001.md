# Iteration 001

## Summary
Implemented the bottle-song (Ten Green Bottles) exercise in Go.

## What Was Accomplished
- Defined goal and scope for the exercise
- Designed implementation through structured debate (iterative vs recursive)
- Selected iterative approach with lookup table as most idiomatic Go
- Implemented `Recite` function in `bottle_song.go`
- All 7 test cases pass, `go vet` clean
- Pushed feature branch `issue-323` to origin

## Issues Encountered
None. Implementation was straightforward once the plan was verified against test cases.

## Key Decisions
- Used a slice (not map) for number-to-word lookup since the domain is fixed 0-10
- Used `unicode.ToUpper` for capitalization instead of deprecated `strings.Title`
- Used iterative approach consistent with existing beer-song exercise pattern
