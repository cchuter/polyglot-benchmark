# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Summary
Implemented the palindrome-products Go exercise in a single iteration. All acceptance criteria met.

## What was accomplished
1. Analyzed the exercise requirements from goal.json, test file, and reference solution
2. Designed 3 candidate approaches, selected direct iteration with string-based palindrome check
3. Codex review caught an unnecessary deviation (numeric vs string palindrome check) — revised plan
4. Implemented solution in `palindrome_products.go`
5. All 5 tests pass, `go vet` clean
6. Committed and pushed to `issue-271` branch

## Issues encountered
- Initial plan used numeric palindrome check; codex review correctly identified this as premature optimization deviating from the reference solution. Revised to string-based approach.

## Test results
```
PASS: TestPalindromeProducts/valid_limits_1-9
PASS: TestPalindromeProducts/valid_limits_10-99
PASS: TestPalindromeProducts/valid_limits_100-999
PASS: TestPalindromeProducts/no_palindromes
PASS: TestPalindromeProducts/fmin_>_fmax
```

## Next steps
- None. Implementation is complete.
