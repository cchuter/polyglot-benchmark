# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Accomplished

- Implemented `Sentence` and `translateWord` functions in `pig_latin.go`
- Used map-based vowel lookup approach (no regex)
- All 4 Pig Latin rules handled in a clean, unified design:
  - Rule 1: Vowel start / "xr" / "yt" → append "ay"
  - Rule 2: Consonant cluster → move to end + "ay"
  - Rule 3: Consonants + "qu" → include "qu" in moved prefix
  - Rule 4: Consonants + "y" → "y" treated as vowel boundary

## Results

- **22/22 tests pass**
- **go vet clean**
- Challenger review: PASS (no bugs found)
- Verifier verdict: **PASS** — all acceptance criteria met

## Issues Encountered

None. Single iteration was sufficient.
