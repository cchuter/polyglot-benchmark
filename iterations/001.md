# Iteration 001 - Beer Song Implementation

## Accomplished
- Defined goal and scope for the beer-song exercise
- Designed implementation plan and received codex review
- Implemented solution in `go/exercises/practice/beer-song/beer_song.go`
- All tests pass, no vet issues
- Committed and pushed to `issue-86` branch

## Key Decisions
- Used `bytes.Buffer` for efficient string building in `Verses()`
- Used switch statement in `Verse()` for clean handling of special cases (0, 1, 2)
- Appended `\n` after every verse in `Verses()` (including last) to match test expectations

## Issues Encountered
- None. Straightforward implementation matching the reference solution pattern.

## Result
- All 12 test cases pass on first attempt
- Branch `issue-86` pushed to origin
