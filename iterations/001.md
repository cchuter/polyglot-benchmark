# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## What was accomplished
- Implemented the palindrome-products Go exercise (issue #313)
- Solution written to `go/exercises/practice/palindrome-products/palindrome_products.go`
- All 5 test cases pass:
  - valid_limits_1-9
  - valid_limits_10-99
  - valid_limits_100-999
  - no_palindromes
  - fmin_>_fmax
- `go vet` clean
- Code committed and pushed to `issue-313` branch

## Approach
- Brute-force nested loop checking all products in range
- `isPal` helper converts int to string and checks with two-pointer
- `compare` closure handles both min/max tracking DRY
- Error handling for invalid range and no-palindromes case

## Team Cycle
1. Implementer wrote the solution and committed
2. Challenger reviewed — no issues found
3. Executor ran tests — all 5 pass
4. Verifier independently confirmed — PASS verdict

## Issues encountered
- None. Single iteration was sufficient.

## Next steps
- Push complete, ready for PR creation
