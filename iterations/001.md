# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## What Was Accomplished
- Analyzed the bottle-song exercise requirements from issue #153 and test cases
- Designed implementation plan with number-to-word mapping, pluralization helper, and main Recite function
- Implemented solution in `go/exercises/practice/bottle-song/bottle_song.go`
- All 7 test cases pass, `go vet` clean
- Committed and pushed to `issue-153` branch

## Issues Encountered
- None. The exercise was straightforward with clear test cases.

## Key Implementation Details
- `numberWords` slice maps 0-10 to English words ("no", "one", ..., "ten")
- `capitalize` helper title-cases the first character for verse lines 1-2
- `bottlePlural` returns singular "bottle" for n==1, "bottles" otherwise
- Line 3 is constant: "And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,"
- Verses separated by empty string elements in the returned slice

## Next Steps
- Create PR for merge into main
