# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the `Cost` function for the book-store exercise in a single iteration cycle.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope** — Defined clear acceptance criteria (18 test cases, integer arithmetic, correct function signature) and scope boundaries (single file modification only).

2. **Design** — Designed a frequency histogram with 5+3→4+4 optimization algorithm. Codex review confirmed the algorithm is correct for all 18 test cases with manual traces.

3. **Implementation** — The implementer wrote the `Cost` function in `book_store.go` using:
   - Frequency counting with `map[int]int`
   - Descending sort of frequencies
   - Histogram layer-peeling to determine group sizes
   - 5+3→4+4 pair optimization (saves 40 cents per pair)
   - Integer cost table summation

4. **Review** — Challenger confirmed: no off-by-one errors, no panic vectors, correct edge case handling, plan adherence verified.

5. **Testing** — All 18/18 tests pass. Benchmark: ~11,255 ns/op on AMD Threadripper PRO.

6. **Verification** — Independent verifier confirmed PASS on all acceptance criteria.

## Issues Encountered

None. The algorithm was correct on first implementation.

## Team Members
