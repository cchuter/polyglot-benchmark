# Iteration 002 — Final Implementation

## Summary
Implemented the alphametics solver using coefficient-based backtracking with bounds pruning. All 10 test cases pass in 5ms.

## What Was Accomplished

### Implementation
- **File modified**: `go/exercises/practice/alphametics/alphametics.go`
- **Algorithm**: Coefficient-based backtracking
  1. Parse puzzle → extract words (addends + result)
  2. Compute per-letter coefficients from positional values (+ve for addends, -ve for result)
  3. Sort letters by |coefficient| descending for early pruning
  4. Backtracking solver with bitmask digit tracking and bounds pruning
- **Helper function**: `availMinMax` — returns smallest/largest available digits given used-digit bitmask

### Verification
- All 10 test cases pass (0.005s total)
- Function signature matches: `func Solve(puzzle string) (map[string]int, error)`
- Package is `alphametics`
- No test files modified
- Leading zero constraint enforced
- Error returned for unsolvable puzzles

### Team Workflow
- Implementer wrote the code and committed
- Verifier independently confirmed all acceptance criteria pass
- Team shut down after PASS verdict

## Issues Encountered
- None. The coefficient-based approach worked correctly on first implementation.

## Commit
- `5b86868` — Implement alphametics solver with coefficient-based backtracking
- Branch `issue-88` pushed to origin
