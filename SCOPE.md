- All logic needed to solve the domino chain problem (graph checks, backtracking, chain construction)

## Out of Scope

- Modifying test files (`dominoes_test.go`, `cases_test.go`)
- Modifying `go.mod`
- Modifying `.meta/` or `.docs/` files
- Adding new test cases
- Performance optimization beyond what's needed to pass the existing tests and benchmarks
- Changes to any other exercises or files outside the dominoes directory

## Dependencies
