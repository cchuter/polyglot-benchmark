# Scope: Book Store Exercise

## In Scope

- Implementing the `Cost` function in `go/exercises/practice/book-store/book_store.go`
- Ensuring all 18 test cases pass
- Optimal discount grouping algorithm

## Out of Scope

- Modifying test files (`book_store_test.go`, `cases_test.go`)
- Modifying `go.mod`
- Changes to any other exercise or file outside the `book-store` directory
- Adding external dependencies
- Performance optimization beyond passing the benchmark test

## Dependencies

- Go 1.18+ (as specified in `go.mod`)
- No external packages; standard library only (likely no imports needed)
