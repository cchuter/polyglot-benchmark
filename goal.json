  "body": "# Instructions\n\nImplement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.\n\nGiven an English text, output the encoded version of that text.\n\nFirst, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the message is down-cased.\n\nThen, the normalized characters are broken into rows.\nThese rows can be regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.\n\nFor example, the sentence\n\n```text\n\"If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots.\"\n```\n\nis normalized to:\n\n```text\n\"ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots\"\n```\n\nThe plaintext should be organized into a rectangle as square as possible.\nThe size of the rectangle should be decided by the length of the message.\n\nIf `c` is the number of columns and `r` is the number of rows, then for the rectangle `r` x `c` find the smallest possible integer `c` such that:\n\n- `r * c \u003e= length of message`,\n- and `c \u003e= r`,\n- and `c - r \u003c= 1`.\n\nOur normalized text is 54 characters long, dictating a rectangle with `c = 8` and `r = 7`:\n\n```text\n\"ifmanwas\"\n\"meanttos\"\n\"tayonthe\"\n\"groundgo\"\n\"dwouldha\"\n\"vegivenu\"\n\"sroots  \"\n```\n\nThe coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.\n\nThe message above is coded as:\n\n```text\n\"imtgdvsfearwermayoogoanouuiontnnlvtwttddesaohghnsseoau\"\n```\n\nOutput the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles `(r X c)`, with `c` chunks of `r` length, separated by spaces.\nFor phrases that are `n` characters short of the perfect rectangle, pad each of the last `n` chunks with a single trailing space.\n\n```text\n\"imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau \"\n```\n\nNotice that were we to stack these, we could visually decode the ciphertext back in to the original message:\n\n```text\n\"imtgdvs\"\n\"fearwer\"\n\"mayoogo\"\n\"anouuio\"\n\"ntnnlvt\"\n\"wttddes\"\n\"aohghn \"\n\"sseoau \"\n```\n\n---\nExercise from [Exercism](https://exercism.org), sourced via the [Aider Polyglot Benchmark](https://github.com/cchuter/polyglot-benchmark).\nAll exercise content is copyright © Exercism, used under open source license.",
