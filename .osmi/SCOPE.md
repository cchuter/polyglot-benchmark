# Scope: Dominoes Chain Solver (Issue #164)

## In Scope

- Implement `Domino` type and `MakeChain` function in `go/exercises/practice/dominoes/dominoes.go`
- The implementation must pass all existing test cases in `dominoes_test.go` and `cases_test.go`
- Solution must handle: empty input, single dominos, multi-element chains, disconnected graphs, backtracking

## Out of Scope

- Modifying test files (`dominoes_test.go`, `cases_test.go`)
- Modifying `go.mod`
- Adding new test cases
- Performance optimization beyond what's needed to pass the benchmark
- Changes to any other exercise or non-dominoes files

## Dependencies

- Go 1.18+ (as specified in go.mod)
- No external packages — standard library only
- No dependencies on other exercises in the repository
