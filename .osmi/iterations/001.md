# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Summary
Implemented the domino chain solver for issue #335 in a single iteration.

## What Was Accomplished
- Defined goal, scope, and acceptance criteria
- Designed solution through structured debate (graph-theoretic vs backtracking)
- Selected backtracking with graph pre-checks as the winning approach
- Implemented the solution in `go/exercises/practice/dominoes/dominoes.go`
- All 11 test cases pass; `go vet` clean
- Pushed feature branch `issue-335` to origin

## Algorithm
1. **Pre-validation**: Even-degree check + union-find connectivity — O(E) fast rejection
2. **Backtracking**: DFS placing dominoes one-by-one, matching chain ends, with domino flipping

## Issues Encountered
- None. All tests passed on the first implementation.

## Key Decision
Chose backtracking over Hierholzer's algorithm for simplicity and lower implementation risk. Added graph-theoretic pre-checks from the Euler approach for fast rejection of impossible cases.
