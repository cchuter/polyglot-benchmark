# Iteration 001: polyglot-go-alphametics (Issue #21)

## Date: 2026-02-15

## Summary

Successfully verified and closed the alphametics exercise implementation. The solution was already complete from a prior fix (commit `80330aa`, PR #14).

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal Phase**: Defined acceptance criteria (10 test cases, function signature, leading-zero constraints) and scope boundaries
2. **Design Phase**: Created implementation plan noting no code changes needed; self-reviewed the plan
3. **Implementation Phase**: Spawned 4-agent team (implementer, challenger, executor, verifier)
   - **Implementer**: Verified `go vet` and `gofmt` pass, wrote changelog
   - **Challenger**: Thorough adversarial review found no bugs, security issues, or edge case gaps
   - **Executor**: Ran full test suite — 10/10 tests pass in ~1.2s, `go vet` clean
   - **Verifier**: Independent audit confirmed all 16 acceptance criteria met — **PASS**
4. **Convergence**: Committed `.osmi/` artifacts, pushed feature branch

## Issues Encountered

- The executor initially had stale test results from the previous issue (beer-song). The verifier independently ran tests, catching and bypassing this issue.
- No code changes were needed — the implementation was already correct.

## Test Results

| Test Case | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| puzzle with three letters | PASS |
| solution must have unique value for each letter | PASS |
| leading zero solution is invalid | PASS |
| puzzle with two digits final carry | PASS |
| puzzle with four letters | PASS |
| puzzle with six letters | PASS |
| puzzle with seven letters | PASS |
| puzzle with eight letters | PASS |
| puzzle with ten letters | PASS |
| puzzle with ten letters and 199 addends | PASS |

## Verdict

**PASS** — All acceptance criteria met. No code changes required.
