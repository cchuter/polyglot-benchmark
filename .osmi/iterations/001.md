# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Summary
Implemented the dominoes chain solver for issue #164 in a single iteration.

## What was accomplished
1. **Goal & Scope** defined in GOAL.md and SCOPE.md
2. **Plan** written and reviewed by codex — approved with no blocking issues
3. **Implementation** of `MakeChain` in `dominoes.go` using:
   - Even-degree check for fast rejection of impossible inputs
   - Union-Find connectivity check to detect disconnected graphs
   - Backtracking DFS to construct valid chains with domino flipping
4. **All 12 tests pass**, `go vet` clean
5. **Pushed** to `issue-164` branch on origin

## Issues encountered
- Initial implementation had a slice aliasing concern with `append` in recursive backtracking. Resolved by returning the slice from `solve` rather than mutating in place.

## Next steps
- Create PR from `issue-164` → `main`
