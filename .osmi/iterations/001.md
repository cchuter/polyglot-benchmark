# Iteration 001: paasio Implementation

## Accomplished

- Analyzed the paasio exercise requirements: IO statistics wrappers for a PaaS billing system
- Defined goal and scope in GOAL.md and SCOPE.md
- Designed implementation plan using sync.Mutex for thread-safe counter snapshots
- Got plan review (approved, no issues)
- Implemented solution in `paasio.go` with:
  - Shared `counter` type with mutex-protected `addBytes`/`count` methods
  - `readCounter` wrapping `io.Reader`
  - `writeCounter` wrapping `io.Writer`
  - `rwCounter` composing both via interface embedding
- All 13 tests pass including concurrency tests (8000 goroutines)
- `go vet` clean
- Pushed branch `issue-183` to origin

## Issues Encountered

None. The implementation was straightforward and all tests passed on the first run.

## Next Steps

- Create PR for merge into main (Closes #183)
