# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the markdown-to-HTML parser for the `polyglot-go-markdown` exercise (issue #349).

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope Definition** — Analyzed the exercise requirements, test cases, and reference solution
2. **Design** — Evaluated two approaches (line-by-line vs type-driven), selected the simpler line-by-line approach
3. **Implementation** — Wrote `markdown.go` with three functions:
   - `Render(markdown string) string` — main entry point
   - `getHeadingLevel(line string) int` — heading level parser
   - `renderInlineHTML(text string) string` — bold/italic formatter
4. **Verification** — All 17 test cases pass, `go vet` clean
5. **Push** — Feature branch `issue-349` pushed to origin

## Issues Encountered

None. The exercise was straightforward with a clear reference solution.

## Final State

- Branch: `issue-349`
- All tests passing
- Ready for PR/merge
