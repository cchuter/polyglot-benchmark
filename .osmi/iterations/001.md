# Iteration 001

## Summary
Completed full implementation of the matrix exercise in a single iteration.

## Accomplished
1. Analyzed issue requirements and test file to understand the API contract
2. Created GOAL.md and SCOPE.md defining acceptance criteria and boundaries
3. Evaluated 3 design branches; selected named slice type approach
4. Implemented solution in `matrix.go` (~70 lines)
5. All 17 tests pass, `go vet` clean

## Issues Encountered
- No codex agent available for plan review; performed self-review instead
- No issues encountered during implementation

## Key Decisions
- Used `type Matrix [][]int` (named slice) for nil-comparability required by benchmarks
- Used `strings.Fields` to handle leading whitespace in row data
- Used `append([]int{}, row...)` idiom for deep copies in Rows()

## Next Steps
- Push feature branch to origin
- Finalize convergence artifacts
