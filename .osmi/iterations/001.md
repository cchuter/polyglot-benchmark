# Iteration 001

## Summary

Implemented the beer-song exercise (Issue #149) in a single iteration.

## What was accomplished

1. Explored the codebase and understood the exercise requirements from tests and reference solution
2. Wrote GOAL.md and SCOPE.md defining acceptance criteria
3. Created implementation plan and had it reviewed (approved with minor notes)
4. Implemented `Verse`, `Verses`, and `Song` functions in `beer_song.go`
5. All 12 tests pass, `go vet` clean

## Issues encountered

None. The implementation was straightforward following the reference solution pattern.

## Key decisions

- Used switch-based approach for `Verse` to handle 4 special cases (invalid, 0, 1, 2) plus default
- Used `bytes.Buffer` for efficient string concatenation in `Verses`
- Appended `\n` after every verse in `Verses` (including the last) to produce the expected trailing blank line

## Next steps

- Push feature branch to origin
- Close issue
