# Iteration 001: Connect Exercise Implementation

## Accomplished
- Analyzed issue #156 requirements for the Hex/Connect board game exercise
- Defined goal and scope documents
- Designed DFS flood-fill algorithm with bit-flag visited tracking
- Got codex review confirming algorithm correctness
- Implemented solution in `go/exercises/practice/connect/connect.go`
- All 10 test cases pass, `go vet` clean
- Pushed feature branch `issue-156` to origin

## Issues Encountered
- None. The reference solution in `.meta/example.go` provided a clear algorithmic pattern.

## Key Decisions
- Used recursive DFS (sufficient for test board sizes up to 9x9)
- Used bit flags on int8 fields for O(1) visited checks without extra data structures
- Value receivers on board struct (slice backing array is shared, enabling mutation)
