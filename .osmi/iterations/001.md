# Iteration 001 - Counter Exercise Complete

## Date
2026-02-16

## Summary
Verified and completed the counter exercise (issue #201). This is a special exercise where the test suite IS the solution. The pre-existing test suite in `counter_test.go` correctly detects bugs in all three incorrect implementations while passing for the correct one.

## Accomplishments
1. Analyzed the counter exercise structure: 4 implementations (3 buggy, 1 correct), Counter interface, makeCounter factory
2. Identified bugs in each implementation:
   - Impl1: Wrong line counting (counts newlines, not lines)
   - Impl2: ASCII-only letter counting (misses Unicode)
   - Impl3: Byte-level iteration (wrong character count for multi-byte Unicode)
3. Verified test suite detects all bugs:
   - Impl1: 4 tests fail (line-related tests)
   - Impl2: 1 test fails (TestUnicodeLetters - Letters)
   - Impl3: 1 test fails (TestUnicodeLetters - Characters)
   - Impl4: All 9 tests pass
4. Team cycle completed: implementer verified, challenger reviewed, executor ran tests, verifier confirmed PASS

## Issues Encountered
- No code changes required - the test suite was already the complete solution
- The implementer couldn't commit because there were no file modifications

## Result
PASS - All acceptance criteria met
