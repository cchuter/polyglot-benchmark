# Iteration 001

## Summary

Completed the full implementation of the beer-song exercise (issue #93).

## What was accomplished

1. **Goal phase**: Defined acceptance criteria and scope in GOAL.md and SCOPE.md
2. **Design phase**: Evaluated 3 approaches (switch-case, template-based, lookup table); selected switch-case for simplicity
3. **Implementation phase**: Implemented `Verse`, `Verses`, and `Song` functions in `beer_song.go`
4. **Verification**: All tests pass, `go vet` clean

## Issues encountered

- No codex agent available for plan review; performed self-review instead
- No issues with implementation — straightforward exercise

## Key decisions

- Used switch-case approach matching the reference solution pattern
- Handled 4 verse categories: standard (3-99), verse 2, verse 1, verse 0
- Used `bytes.Buffer` for efficient string concatenation in `Verses()`

## Next steps

- Push feature branch to origin
- Finalize status
