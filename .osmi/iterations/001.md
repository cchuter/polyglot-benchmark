# Iteration 001: Pig Latin Implementation

## Summary
Implemented the Pig Latin translator for the Go polyglot benchmark exercise. Single iteration — all tests passed on first attempt.

## What was accomplished
1. Analyzed the exercise requirements (4 translation rules, 22 test cases)
2. Designed 3 candidate approaches, selected the simple imperative approach
3. Implemented `Sentence`, `translateWord`, and `isVowel` in `pig_latin.go`
4. All 22 tests pass, `go vet` clean
5. Pushed feature branch `issue-273` to origin

## Key decisions
- Used a single scan loop with rule priority: Rule 1 (prefix check) → Rule 3 (qu) → Rule 4 (y) → Rule 2 (vowel)
- Treated "y" as consonant at position 0 but vowel-like after consonant cluster (via `i > 0` guard)
- Used `strings.Fields` for word splitting (handles multiple spaces gracefully)

## Issues encountered
- No codex agent available for plan review; performed self-review instead
- No issues with implementation — all tests passed on first run

## Files modified
- `go/exercises/practice/pig-latin/pig_latin.go` (40 lines added)
