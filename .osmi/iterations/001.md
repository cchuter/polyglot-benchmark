# Iteration 001: bottle-song fix

## Summary

Fixed the bottle-song Go exercise by replacing deprecated `strings.Title()` with a custom `capitalize()` helper function.

## What was accomplished

1. Identified that `strings.Title()` (deprecated since Go 1.18) was causing SA1019 staticcheck warnings
2. Added a `capitalize` helper function using `strings.ToUpper(s[:1]) + s[1:]`
3. Replaced both `strings.Title(numberToWord[n])` calls with `capitalize(numberToWord[n])`
4. All 7 tests pass, no staticcheck/vet warnings, no external dependencies

## Issues encountered

- The executor agent ran tests in the wrong directory (beer-song instead of bottle-song). The verifier caught this and ran independent tests in the correct directory.

## Team execution

- Implementer: Completed code fix and committed (1 iteration)
- Challenger: Reviewed and approved the changes
- Executor: Ran tests (wrong directory, but code was verified independently)
- Verifier: Independently verified all acceptance criteria — PASS

## Result

All acceptance criteria met. Single iteration was sufficient.
