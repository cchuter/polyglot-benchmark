# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Accomplished
- Analyzed the paasio exercise requirements from issue #355 and test file
- Designed a mutex-based implementation through structured debate (Proposal A: mutex vs Proposal B: atomics)
- Selected mutex approach for correctness guarantees on consistency tests
- Implemented the solution in `go/exercises/practice/paasio/paasio.go`
- All 13 tests pass with race detector enabled
- `go vet` passes clean
- Pushed feature branch `issue-355` to origin

## Issues Encountered
- No tmux-team agents were configured, so codex review was performed as self-review instead
- No other issues — the implementation was straightforward

## Key Design Decision
Mutex-based approach was chosen over atomics because the consistency tests require that bytes and ops are always observed in a consistent state (nops == n / numBytes). A mutex ensures both fields are updated atomically together.
