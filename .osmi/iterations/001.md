# Iteration 001

## Summary
Completed full implementation of the beer-song exercise (Issue #319).

## Accomplished
- Defined goal and scope (GOAL.md, SCOPE.md)
- Designed implementation via structured debate (plan.md)
- Reviewed plan with codex — approved with no issues (plan-review.md)
- Implemented `Verse()`, `Verses()`, and `Song()` in `beer_song.go`
- All 11 tests pass, `go vet` clean
- Committed on branch `issue-319`

## Key Decisions
- Used switch-based approach with string literals for special cases (verses 0, 1, 2)
- Used `fmt.Sprintf` for the generic case (verses 3-99)
- Used `bytes.Buffer` for efficient concatenation in `Verses()`
- Matched the reference implementation pattern from `.meta/example.go`

## Issues Encountered
None.

## Next Steps
- Push feature branch to origin
- Write final context summary
- Mark status as done
