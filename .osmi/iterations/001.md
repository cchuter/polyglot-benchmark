# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## What Was Accomplished

- Defined goal and scope for the alphametics puzzle solver (Issue #92)
- Designed three candidate approaches and selected coefficient-based backtracking
- Implemented the `Solve` function in `alphametics.go` (~120 lines)
- All 10 test cases pass, including the large 199-addend puzzle
- `go vet` passes with no issues
- Committed to `issue-92` branch

## Key Decisions

1. **Coefficient approach over column-by-column:** Reduces each puzzle to a single linear equation, making the per-permutation check O(n) regardless of addend count
2. **Recursive backtracking over pre-generated permutations:** Avoids materializing 10! permutations in memory; enables early termination
3. **Leading-zero constraint on multi-digit words only:** Single-letter words can be zero per problem specification

## Issues Encountered

- None. Implementation was straightforward.

## Next Steps

- Push feature branch to origin
- Finalize convergence artifacts
