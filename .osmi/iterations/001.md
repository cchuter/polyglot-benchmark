# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Summary
Implemented the dominoes chain solver for issue #251 in a single iteration.

## Accomplished
1. Analyzed the problem: domino chaining is equivalent to finding an Eulerian circuit in a multigraph
2. Designed three candidate approaches (graph+backtracking, Hierholzer's, permutation-based)
3. Selected graph theory + backtracking as the best balance of simplicity, correctness, and efficiency
4. Implemented the solution in ~100 lines of Go
5. All 12 test cases pass, `go vet` clean
6. Pushed to `issue-251` branch

## Key Decisions
- Used union-find for connectivity check (simpler than BFS/DFS on adjacency lists)
- Even-degree check rejects impossible inputs in O(n)
- Backtracking handles both domino orientations, with early termination
- Self-loops handled correctly (d[0] != d[1] guard prevents double-trying same orientation)

## Issues Encountered
- None. Clean implementation on first attempt.
