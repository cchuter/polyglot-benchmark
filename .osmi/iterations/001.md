# Iteration 001: Implementation Complete

## Date
2026-02-15

## Summary
Successfully implemented the `Recite` function for the bottle-song Go exercise (Issue #45) in a single iteration cycle.

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Goal Phase**: Defined acceptance criteria and scope for implementing the "Ten Green Bottles" song generator
2. **Design Phase**: Created implementation plan with capitalize helper, bottleWord helper, number-to-word map, verse generator, and Recite assembler. Plan self-reviewed and approved.
3. **Implementation Phase**: Team of 4 agents (implementer, challenger, executor, verifier) worked sequentially:
   - Implementer wrote the code and committed
   - Challenger reviewed for correctness (PASS)
   - Executor ran go vet and go test -v (all 7 tests PASS)
   - Verifier independently confirmed all 10 acceptance criteria (PASS)

## Key Implementation Details
- `numberToWord` map covers 0-10
- `capitalize` helper using `strings.ToUpper` for first character
- `bottleWord` helper for singular/plural
- Generalized `verse` function using fmt.Sprintf with helpers
- `Recite` loops and assembles verses with empty string separators

## Issues Encountered
- None. Single-iteration success.

## Result
PASS - All 7 tests pass, go vet clean, no external dependencies.
