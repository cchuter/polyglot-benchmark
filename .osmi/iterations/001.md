# Iteration 001: Matrix Exercise Complete

## Accomplished

- Analyzed test file to understand the required API: `New()`, `Rows()`, `Cols()`, `Set()`
- Identified that `Matrix` must be nil-comparable (benchmark uses `var matrix Matrix` + nil check)
- Chose `type Matrix [][]int` as the type — nil-comparable, supports methods, reference semantics for Set
- Implemented all four functions in `matrix.go`
- All 17 tests pass (9 valid cases, 7 invalid cases for New; 9 Rows; 9 Cols; 1 Set with comprehensive sub-cases)
- `go vet` clean
- Committed and pushed to `issue-179` branch

## Key Decisions

- **`Matrix` as named slice type**: Struct wouldn't be nil-comparable. Interface would add unnecessary complexity. Named slice is the simplest type that satisfies all constraints.
- **`strings.Fields` for parsing**: Handles arbitrary whitespace including leading spaces (test case `" 8 7 6"`)
- **Deep copy in Rows/Cols**: Tests verify that mutating returned slices doesn't affect the matrix

## Issues Encountered

None — implementation was straightforward once the type constraint was identified.

## Next Steps

Issue is complete. Ready for PR review.
