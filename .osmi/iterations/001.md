# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Summary
Implemented the `Cost` function for the book-store exercise (issue #237). All 18 test cases pass, `go vet` is clean, and the feature branch has been pushed to origin.

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Goal phase**: Analyzed the problem — a book pricing optimization requiring optimal grouping of books for maximum discounts
2. **Design phase**: Evaluated 3 approaches (greedy+optimization, DP/memoization, frequency-based computation). Selected greedy with 5+3→4+4 pair optimization for its simplicity and correctness
3. **Implementation phase**: Wrote `Cost` function in `book_store.go` (~70 lines including helper)
4. **Verification**: All 18 tests pass, `go vet` clean

## Algorithm
- Count book frequencies, sort descending
- Greedily form groups of distinct books (largest possible)
- Optimize by converting (5-group + 3-group) pairs to (4-group + 4-group) pairs (saves 40 cents each)

## Issues Encountered
- Plan review identified that `min()` builtin requires Go 1.21+ but `go.mod` specifies 1.18. Used an if-statement instead.
- No Codex agent available in tmux for plan review; performed self-review.

## Files Modified
- `go/exercises/practice/book-store/book_store.go` — implemented `Cost` and `groupCost` functions

## Next Steps
- None — implementation is complete
