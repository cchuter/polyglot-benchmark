# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Summary

Implemented the alphametics puzzle solver for issue #99 in a single iteration.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope**: Defined clear acceptance criteria and scope boundaries
2. **Design**: Evaluated column-based vs permutation-based approaches; selected a weighted-sum permutation approach with backtracking as the optimal balance of simplicity and performance
3. **Implementation**: Wrote the `Solve` function in `alphametics.go` using:
   - Puzzle parsing (split on `==` and `+`)
   - Per-letter weight computation (positional value across all words)
   - Leading-zero constraint tracking
   - Letters sorted by descending weight magnitude for pruning
   - Recursive backtracking with running sum
4. **Testing**: All 10 test cases pass in 0.02s, `go vet` clean

## Issues Encountered

None. The approach worked on the first implementation.

## Key Decision

The weighted-sum approach was critical for performance: rather than evaluating the full equation on each complete assignment, we reduce to a single integer sum check. Combined with sorting by weight magnitude, this allows the 199-addend/10-letter test to solve in <1ms.
