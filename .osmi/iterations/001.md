# Iteration 001: Counter Exercise Solution

## Summary

The counter exercise is a test-design exercise where the task is to have a comprehensive test suite that detects bugs in 4 provided implementations (3 buggy, 1 correct). The test suite in `counter_test.go` was already pre-populated with 9 well-designed tests covering all required edge cases.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Goal & Scope**: Defined acceptance criteria and scope boundaries
2. **Design**: Evaluated two approaches (accept existing tests vs. enhance them); selected the pragmatic approach of accepting the existing comprehensive test suite
3. **Implementation**: Verified all acceptance criteria through a 4-member team:
   - Implementer: Confirmed test suite and committed artifacts
   - Challenger: Reviewed test correctness with detailed trace analysis
   - Executor: Ran build and tests for all 4 implementations
   - Verifier: Independently confirmed all 6 acceptance criteria met

## Test Results

| Implementation | Pass | Fail | Bug Detected |
|---|---|---|---|
| Impl4 (correct) | 9/9 | 0 | N/A |
| Impl1 (line counting) | 5/9 | 4 | Only counts `\n`, missing +1 for non-newline-ending |
| Impl2 (ASCII letters) | 8/9 | 1 | Only counts ASCII letters, misses Unicode |
| Impl3 (byte iteration) | 8/9 | 1 | Counts bytes not runes for multi-byte chars |

## Key Decision

No code modifications were needed. The `counter_test.go` test suite was already complete and correct, matching the pattern from the prior solution (PR #246).

## Files Changed

Only `.osmi/` documentation artifacts were created. No source code files were modified.
