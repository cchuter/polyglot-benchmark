# Iteration 001: Complete Implementation

## Accomplished
- Analyzed issue #260 requirements and test expectations
- Defined goal and scope documents
- Designed 3 candidate approaches, selected map-based approach (Branch 1)
- Implemented `Garden` type with `NewGarden` constructor and `Plants` method
- All 15 tests pass, `go vet` clean
- Committed and pushed to `issue-260` branch

## Issues Encountered
- No Codex agent available for external plan review; performed self-review instead
- No issues with implementation — straightforward match to reference solution

## Next Steps
- Create pull request for merge into main
